          While in Galvanize's web development program, I was part of a group project where we had four days to produce a full stack web app. The assignment required that we must use at least one major technology that was not taught in the curriculum.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life_(biology)#/media/File:Darwins_tree_of_life_1859.png">we aren't the first to draw a phylogenetic tree</a>, but we thought it would be fun to try to make one that is beautiful, interactive, and highly useable.
        </p>
        <p>
          The major tasks of the project were to find the data, parse it into a usable format, and then figure out how to display it in a visually meaningful way.
        </p>
        <p>
          We anticipated that the biggest challenge would be to create the visualization, but it turned out that the hardest part was wrangling the data. We were banking on a certain API, but it turned out to be a poor fit for our use case. In the end, we downloaded a database containing all organisms in the phylum chordata, and then wrote scripts to parse the data "by hand". Our scripts gave us nicely formatted JSON that we could feed right into D3.
        </p>
        <p>
          We think the end result is pretty neat!
        </p>
        <p>
          Technologies used: D3, Angular
